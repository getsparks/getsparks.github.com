<h3><FONT COLOR="RED">About XPlayer</FONT></h3>

<h5>Cross-platforms</h5>

<p>You can run XPlayer on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux smoothly with the native and exactly the same UI with consistency experience, absolutely no new skills to learn.
iOS and Android platform support also on the plan.</p>

<h5>Multiple formats support seamlessly</h5>

<p>Seamlessly support mp2, mp3, wma, m4a, mp4(Yes, even video file), ogg, oga, flac, wav, aiff, aac, and more, and even more to support with extra plugins installed.</p>

<h5>Multiple protocol support natively</h5>

<p>You can play files at the following protocol:
<br>*Adding file from local hard disk using file:// protocol;
<br>*UNC share or Samba mount point like: \\server\share or //server/share;
<br>*Remotes or local http protocol based URL;
<br>*Online streamings: mms://, rtsp://, etc;
<br>*And more...
</p>

<h5>Extremely stable thanks to the design of Core Sound Daemon works without User Interface</h5>

<p>All new design, benefit of gaining way more better stability and security for automation/on-air.
<br>We separated the User Interface and the Core Sound Daemon, with this gorgeous feature, you can even close the User Interface without stopping the playback. After closing the user interface, the system is extremely stable ever with less resource hungry.
</p>

<h5>Unlimited sound cards and audio channels support</h5>

<p>You can set up as many channels as you want by adding more sound cards. For XPlayer, it just one more config file and one more instance. (Too many channels and instances may slow down the whole operation experience which is not suitable for On-Air.)</p>

<h5>Rich metadata extractor and representation</h5>

<p>More than ten common metadata/tags support. After specifying the root audio folder, XPlayer will extract all those metadata/tags from the audio files then save to database automatically, you don't even need to do that by one single click, it's all automatic. <br>And at the same time you can search files by all those metadata/tags immediately, super fast and reliable.
<br>You can also edit and customize the metadata/tags by other products from Sparks, or even from open source software.
</p>

<h5>Lighting search</h5>

<p>The search action triggered at the same time you typed, you finished typing, the result is out there already!</p>

<h5>Multiple playlists support</h5>

<p>You can save an load as many playlists as you want. <br>Save the current playing queue as a unique playlist for future usage? Just one click. <br>Load or merge a more suitable playlist to current playing queue? Also one click. <br>Simple yet powerful.
</p>

<h5>Rich featured playback control</h5>

<p>XPlayer could let you control the playback as easy as 123, multiple intuitive checkboxs let you switch modes on the fly. 
<br><strong>Single</strong> mode is great for live programme, after each song finished, XPlayer stopped automatically, waiting for DJ's break.
<br><strong>Repeat</strong> mode lets you worry no about the stop/outage issues for oops. It smartly replay from the start of the current playlist, non-stop indeed. You can also combine <strong>Single</strong> and <strong>Repeat</strong> mode to get the loop effect, which was great for live programme being acted as a background music.
<br><strong>Random</strong> mode let XPlayer do the magic, you never know which one is going to be the next. Combining <strong>Random</strong> with <strong>Repeat</strong> mode to get infinite random.
<br><strong>Consume</strong> mode gives you a cleaner playlist and easy to focus, it consumes each track after playback, it will disapeared from the current playlist after playback, also great for live programme. Combining <strong>Consume</strong> mode with <strong>Single</strong> mode to get a cart player experience and also a software-based 'fader start' experience(Using keyboard hotkey to emulate).
</p>

<h5>Totally configurable UI</h5>

<p>You can configure the user interface as you like. It's totally configurable.</p>

<h5>Multiple views for easy exploring</h5>

<p>XPlayer comes with multiple views to represent the database you have, by Artists/Albums/Tracks view; by Collection folder view; by Files view; with more to come. <br>It is intuitive and easy to understand which lets you way more easy to checkout what you want.
</p>
